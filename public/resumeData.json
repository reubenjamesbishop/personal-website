    "bio": "Hi! My name is Reuben Bishop, and I'm an engineer based out of Adelaide, Australia. I love learning and making things, and I'm always down to jump on a new project or pickup another technology. I have special interests in data science, machine learning, cloud and full stack web development. While I'm mainly interested in software nowadays, I also love design and build projects and have a strong mechanical engineering background. Between freelance work, contracting, internships and my full time gig, I've had experience in a wide range of industries including medical, mining, technology, defence and energy. Please reach out to me if you have any questions, or just want to chat!",
